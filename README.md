# FinalProject

Purpose: Pong is used as a training program that teaches all the basic concepts for coding as well as incredibly complex ones as more things get added

Description: Rewriting OOP Pong and adding FINAL to methods and classes. Fully functional Pong game with encapsulated variables

Through the semester I enjoyed working with Pong especially with the object orientated version. When the final project was introduced I was interested to see how I could transform my OOP Pong and add inheritance to ensure the numerous variables that exist within my program are declared only once.

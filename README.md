# FinalProject

- Rewriting OOP Pong and adding FINAL to methods and classes

- Fully functional Pong game with encapsulated variables

Through the semester I enjoyed working with Pong especially with the object orientated version. When the final project was introduced I was interested to see how I could transform my OOP Pong and add inheritance to ensure the numerous variables that exist within my program are declared only once.
